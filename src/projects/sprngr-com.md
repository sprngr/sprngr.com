I started this in 2019 as a sort of fresh reset. Most of that story is outlined in this [first blog post](https://sprngr.com/posts/2020-04-09-hello-world/).

The whole build is generated via [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) inside of a Github Action, pushed to remote server that runs it inside of a docker container. Possibly overkill as I could also host it on Github Pages, but it gave me a repeatable build/deploy system I use with several other small websites sitting on the same box.

One of my big goals with this was to keep the website as light as possible, cutting any unnecessary frills or functionality. I like to think of it as economical, minimizing dependencies and browser resources.

My other goal for this was to develop in the open, so all of the code is available for your own perusal on [Github](https://github.com/sprngr/sprngr.com).
