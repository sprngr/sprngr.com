I had been contacted to build a chatbot for a 24/7 livestream.

I designed an extensible Javascript based combination chatbot and Twitch client to allow simple interfacing between the Twitch eventing API, chat, and the clientâ€™s proprietary streaming software during their 24hr daily streams, handling over 100 active users at a time.

The chatbot handles synchronizing events between what was occurring on the live stream and corresponding user chat inputs and channel redemption queue, rate limiting & queuing user based actions, and automating ban of known bot users.

The core functionality for the bot leveraged shell scripts, NodeJS, and the [Twurple](https://twurple.js.org/) API wrapper.
