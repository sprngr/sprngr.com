For Magic Con Las Vegas 2025, I reached out to the PDH Pals, a group of content creators popular in the Pauper Commander Magic format space. During their live streamed games, viewer interaction is possible through redemptions of channel points on Twitch, one such popular one is Grumgully's Charred Spark. Given the Pals were going to be in Vegas, I was inspired to bring this channel reward to paper in the form of a scratch-off.

I drew from a visual style that takes from modern slot machines as well as scratch-off lottery tickets. The channel reward is rolled on an 8 sided die which fit with print sheet layouts, but I needed one more to balance it out leading to the decision of a "jackpot" token of an elephant token keeping in theme with the PDH Pals even if it is a bit broken in game to get early. Each scratch-off sticker was placed by hand which resulted in imperfect placement but added to the look and feel of the finished product.
