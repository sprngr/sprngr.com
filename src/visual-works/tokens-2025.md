The following is a collection of fan art game tokens I have produced during 2025. Most of these are available as short print run rewards on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sprngr).

## Snake
I used to do pixel art and wanted revisit that medium for a "Year of the Snake" piece. I implemented a grid to recreate the dot matrix found on older handhelds. While in the process of doing this one, the idea came up to push it further and make a recreation of the Snake mobile game as the token.

## Pixel Creatures
Continuing with pixel art, I created several retro game inspired creatures.

## Pokemon Trainer Food
I had wanted to try my hand at recreating the look and feel of the original Pokemon trading cards. This makes use of metal textures and a digitally painted Slowpoke tail.

## Let's Go Racing!
When the Aetherdrift set for Magic dropped, I wanted to go back to a model kit inspired design. Specifically I borrowed the design of the bike from Akira. While working on that one I ended up churning out a couple more in the Pilot helmet and the Gear shifter pattern speed tracker.

## It wasn't a very good joke
As an April Fool's joke I put together a [joke](https://www.patreon.com/posts/125643504) involving a departure from making fan art tokens.

## Have A Bit of Cake
For my birthday I wanted to put together something nice and everyone was invited.

## National Parks & Forests Proxy Project
I have a larger project involving proxying basic and non basic Magic lands making use of US National Parks & Forests photography from the public domain. I also did a more in depth breakdown on the design as a [collection of blog posts](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1614108).

## D&D Inspired Eldrazi
I had taken a design rough from a different piece and reworked it into something inspired by classic Dungeons & Dragons rules monster manual entries.

## Onamotopoeia Typography
I played around with a purely typopgraphic based approach with the sounds that the creature would make. One of the challenges with this design was finding a good font to fit each unique sound.

## RPG Menu Inspired
With the release of the Final Fantasy Magic set, I was hoping to see more references to the classical menu styling leading me to figure why not do it myself.
