The following is a collection of fan art game tokens I have produced during 2025.

## Snake
I used to do pixel art and wanted revisit that medium for a "Year of the Snake" piece. I implemented a grid to recreate the dot matrix found on older handhelds. While in the process of doing this one, the idea came up to push it further and make a recreation of the Snake mobile game as the token.

## Pixel Creatures
Continuing with pixel art, I created several retro game inspired creatures.

## Pokemon Trainer Food
I had wanted to try my hand at recreating the look and feel of the original Pokemon trading cards. This makes use of metal textures and a digitally painted Slowpoke tail.

## Let's Go Racing!
When the Aetherdrift set for Magic dropped, I wanted to go back to a model kit inspired design. Specifically I borrowed the design of the bike from Akira. While working on that one I ended up churning out a couple more in the Pilot helmet and the Gear shifter pattern speed tracker.

## It wasn't a very good joke
As an April Fool's joke I put together a [joke](https://www.patreon.com/posts/125643504) involving a departure from making fan art tokens.

## Have A Bit of Cake
For my birthday I wanted to put together something nice and everyone was invited.

## National Parks & Forests Proxy Project
I have a larger project involving proxying basic and non basic Magic lands making use of US National Parks & Forests photography from the public domain. More information can be found here.
