This design was commissioned for the Sanctuary IX Pauper Commander tournament on May 31 2025. Typically there is only one winner but due to circumstances they cut to a top 3. I worked with the winners to get feedback on the sort of design they were looking for. It ended up with them going for something a bit self referential to the event itself.

I tried to make the Monarch token feel like a royal decree that had been defaced, including graffiti and slash marks through the crown to represent the division of the win.
