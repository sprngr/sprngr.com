The theme for the [Plamoweekender](https://plamoweekender.com) charity event was Magical Girl. Given the focus is around plastic modeling as a marathon, I provided designs based around a refresh of my hobby tool stickers. Additionall a bottle design was made inspired by a community in joke about using "Pilk" (pepsi + milk) as a donation incentive (curse?).
