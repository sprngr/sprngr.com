The following is a collection of fan art game tokens I have produced during 2024.

## Burger Bag Food
This food token was built out of a composition of photos of fast food bags in order to give it a more authentic feel along with a logo design to incorporate the token name.

## It's a Clue
For this clue I had gone through a couple iterations where I wanted to make it have hidden information in the background, though it ended up looking like gibberish when I tried to apply different cipher texts before ultimately landing on a simple mirror text of the token's rules.

## Model Kit Treasure & Junk
I love building model kits and wanted to try out a design that was dual sided. I had a hard time coming up with a visual to represent as the model being built, eventually landing on a gacha machine after having recently completed a scale model of one - it also fit the idea of the treasure token giving mana likened to the capsules in the machine. The flip side was meant to emulate having opened the box only to find a half used sticker sheet and empty runners.

## Locked Door
I wanted to make a marker to use during games of Magic to support the "locked" room mechanic, making use of a mix of wood and metal textures along wit a glitch effect to fit with the Duskmourn set's horror aesthetic.

## Pudding Pals
This was based around a joke during a PDH Pals charity stream. Pudding was requested and I wanted to make it mimic the look of product packaging.

## Rock Out
I was inspired to make something that felt like a concert poster. The goblin hand was modeled after a photo of my own hand.

## Energy Mana Trackers
This set of mana trackers was inspired by the original Pokemon TCG energy cards.

# Hand Bird
I don't have much to say for this one but I did trace my hand.

## Holiday Mana & Soldier
I wanted to do something that fit the aesthetic of a holiday card. The soldier was inspired by the nutcracker, a common decoration in my childhood home during Christmas time.
