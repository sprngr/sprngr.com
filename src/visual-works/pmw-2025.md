I worked with the [Plamoweekender](https://plamoweekender.com) team on redeveloping the event website and an array of visual assets including those that were provided to the VTuber presenters for use during their segments.

I had also worked on preliminary merchandise designs for the event keeping with the minimalist racing inspired theme the event took on. A common motify used was pin stripes and making use of a simplified color palette that evoked feelings of team markings seen on older racing event posters.
