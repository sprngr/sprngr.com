## Lobbert

I worked with [Lobbert](https://linktr.ee/lobbert) to design a set of tokens for them to distribute at Magic Con Chicago as well as future events. I drew inspiration from their logo to create a "build-a-lobbert" concept where 3 tokens have a motif of accessories being mixed and matched as well as a blank option. The token back drew reference from the visual style they developed for their brand on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lobbert).

## Sanctuary PDH

I worked with Sanctuary PDH to develop a Chicago centric design incorporating the famous [Cloud Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) sculpture's shape into an Eldrazi.The spawn hovering over the city's skyline (with the Sanctuary Tower mixed in) is presented as a sort of horror movie poster style. This went through a few iterations where the "bean" was a cracked egg the spawn came out of. To tie the design together further it was printed with a silver foil to make it shine.

## Poison Counter

I wanted to bring a unique token to hand out during Magic Con. I opted to try coming up with a design that was relevant to the area but would feel unique. The [Malört](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeppson%27s_Mal%C3%B6rt) label was used as the inspiration for the Poison counter (the umlaut was considered briefly but I wasn't sure where to put it), recreating key aspects of it to retain a recognizable homage. I was thrilled to see how many people enjoyed receiving these during the convention, especially those who confirmed Malört may in fact be poison.
