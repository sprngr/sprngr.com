Hi, my name is Michael Springer, often found on the web as [sprngr](https://github.com/sprngr) (or [sprngr_](https://twitter.com/sprngr_) if [I was too late](https://twitch.tv/sprngr_)).

This website is simultaneously a work in progress project & collection of my thoughts, findings, and projects both physical & digital. All code for it is available on [Github](https://github.com/sprngr/sprngr.com).

I am professionally a full stack engineer at JazzHR. 

Independently I am a maker of things such as pixel art, model kits, video games, or whatever I can get my hands on.

I will work on filling out this page later :)
