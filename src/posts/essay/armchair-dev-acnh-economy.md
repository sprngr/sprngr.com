description: This is an essay about the oddities that is the economy of the recently released Animal Crossing title for the Nintendo Switch. I had done a lighting talk on it as part of the lunch & learn education track at work and it has just gotten stranger since then.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a life simulation title that released internationally for the Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020. It couldn't have come at a better time due to the world being in a global pandemic and stay-at-home orders were put in place. At the time of writing the best selling Animal Crossing title in its series and is the fastest selling on the Nintendo Switch<sup>[[1]](#nintendo-fiscal-results)</sup>.

As a player with way too many hours clocked in game, I find it fascinating how this game's virtual economy has developed, having impact in both digital and physical spaces. While it is not uncommon for a video game with a multiplayer component to develop an economy in ways the developers had not anticipated, watching this one unfold has been very interesting.

## What is a Virtual Economy?

A "Virtual Economy" is an emergent economy existing in a virtual world, usually exchanging virtual goods in context of an online game, particularly in massively multiplayer online games.<sup>[[2]](#wikipedia-virtual-econ)</sup>  

People enter these virtual economies for recreation and entertainment rather than necessity. When systems exist to exchange goods between players, they will find ways to manipulate systems either around resources to be acquired or the currency itself. In these cases, often an alternative currency can be established due to a fixed price around it.

## What about Animal Crossing then?

In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, players are able to trade pretty much every kind of item within the game, from furnitures to fruit, the exception being fish and insects. This is pretty bog standard in terms of what one could be expected. What was not expected was how players would build up their own secondary market to trade online through player made systems like [turnip.exchange](https://turnip.exchange/) and [nookazon](https://nookazon.com/), and to the extent of how massive they would become.

Players have even gone as far as to establish methods around trading desired villagers by exploiting the mechanisms when one is moving out and now available to be "adopted" for another's own island barring they also have an open space. It's a song and dance, and there is a lot of money, both real and digital, going around.

On the topic of villagers, the game sports a system to utilize the many Animal Crossing Amiibo cards produced for prevous entries to call up an animal villager on demand and begin the process of enticing them to live on their island, prompting a selected villager to be evicted from their home. This system can be used to make desired villagers available when the prospective buyer has an open plot.

## The Stalk Market

One of my favorite events in the game is the SOW Joan Stalk Market. It has been around since the first title, and is probably the fastest way to make big Bells short of using a duplication glitch.

More on how turnips have a system to combat time travel.

Add tweet about market collapse when online servers went down on a saturday.

## The Villager Market

Cover amiibo card market price spikes before and during game launch after info about selecting villagers was made known.

## Economic Oddities

Island economies are isolated from one another, but the value of the bell has inflated drastically. So much so we are seeing prices become outlandish compared to what they should be.

Case in point, a query on nookazon.com for a common item such as the Axe. The axe is a mainstay tool in the series, dating all the way back to the original release on Game Cube (or N64 if you are from Japan.)

On May 7, 2020 the value of the item on the website was selling at an average price of 5,000 Bells. This already is quite odd given the item is already purchasable from the Nook's Cranny, an in game shop, for 2,500 Bells - and it is craftable by the player. So right there it is already going for 2x the retail price, and it is infinitely purchasable in game so you would expect it to be valued considerably less.

At the time of writing May 10, 2020, the price is now sitting at an average of 13,250 Bells. I was not tracking previous price trends for this item, but within the span of 4 days it has jumped 8,250 Bells, now at 5.3x the original price of the item in game. This of course could be caused by outliers at the far end of the bell curve causing the average price of items to skyrocket, or it could be this demographic of players are now targeting those fresh off the seaplane and looking to get some later game (though this takes a short period of time to acquire, relatively speaking to the game) earlier. Luckily the price of the DIY is still where it should be, given that too is also directly purchasable from Nook's Cranny.

## Combating Hyperinflation

TODO

Nintendo has imposed a change to the in game bank's interest rate, effectively capping it - preventing players from time travelling for maximum gain.

My proposal to discourage time travel would be to impose interest on the loans given out by Tom Nook for house repayments. A typical player will pay it back relatively quickly, whereas the time traveler could likely blow past certain points in time causing their house loan to increase over time effectively nullifying any gains they would have made in interest from the bank. This likely would be turned down as it ruins the idea of playing at your own pace, and people who do not play every day would suddenly see increased costs on what they thought they were paying down.
