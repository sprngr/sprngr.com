[Pokemon Legends: Arceus](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-legends-arceus-switch/) at the time of writing, is the latest installment of the Pokemon franchise and a master class in what happens when instead of adding more ease of use features to the already growing pile on a boilerplate turn based RPG - you upend the formula by removing most of them, turn it into an action RPG and make the game truly feel like survival. For the first time in 20 some years, I actually felt like the challenge to the game was beyond "are my numbers higher" and it was a blast.

This is not a review, I unapologetically loved the game. Is it perfect? Nope. Do I think it could have been longer? Yup. Was I mad my favorite creature was excluded? [Nidoking](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nidoking_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) was not present, but I did have a [Rhyperior](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rhyperior_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) in my party to make up the mantle. Also [Hisuian Growlithe](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Growlithe_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Hisuian_Growlithe_5) is a treasure - a function to pet the dog would have been appreciated though.

I mentioned initially how this game is a great example of removing features improved the game as opposed to adding more to the decades old pile. Every iteration of the core game, Gamefreak adds newer features to enhance the game and improve the experience. While not all may stick around in every version, the list has grown quite large since 1996. Complex things are hard to make simple without rebuilding from the ground up, and I think Legends does this in spades.

## So it's an Action RPG now?

This was primarily one of the big changes introduced. You have your turn based combat, which I will touch on later. But the majority of the game play is done in an overworld where it is you versus nature. Nature being the world itself and all the wild Pokemon that may or may not attack you.

It feels like someone on the design team had played Monster Hunter, decided to experiment with similar mechanics, and it works. 

You can engage with Pokemon in the over world with items to bait, stun, and capture them. There are mechanics to hide, dodge, and of course engage in a fight. If you wanted (I've tried for fun), you can engage a horde of Pokemon with just thrown items, hiding, and dodge rolls to catch them off guard through baiting or stunning them to use to your advantage for capture.

Traditionally, when you run out of Pokemon your fight is over - not so much in this game. When you "run" from a fight, you have to _RUN_ from the fight or else you are at risk to being attacked to the point of fainting. When you faint, you respawn back in a camp but at the risk of losing items from your bag - more on bag mechanics further down.

The survival mechanisms really work well with the open nature of the maps you play in, play into the creature capture functions, and introduce a challenge to the game that hadn't been there before.

## But stuff is removed?

Right. In order to make the game play and feel more like an action/survival role playing game, a lot of mechanics were either removed or simplified. This aids to either adding challenge or streamlining game play. To a degree, a lot of simplifications about the game harken back to Generation 1 when things were just getting started, a good parallel to a setting where you are literally just getting started on a new continent.

### Bag of Not-So-Much Holding

The unlimited and hyper organized inventory is no more. You now have very limited slots initially, and can expand it at exponentially increasing costs (though Key Items are in an infinite space to make sure you can progress the game).

When you faint as the player, you lose items from the bag. This forces you to think about what you're taking into the wild.

Given status effects are limited to battles, this means the limited inventory space isn't as damning by not requiring you maintain constant slots for status healing items and can instead prioritize potions to fix HP or other thrown utilities.

### No Money, More Problems

Money is hard to come by early on, but you can be rewarded for captures and diversity of captures in a run. Rather than being able to farm money from beating up bug catchers, it's a much bigger slog - though that gets a bit easier the more star ranks you get. To offset a lot of this, there is a crafting system that lets you go hunter-gatherer and acquire materials to build everything from Pokeballs to potions.

### Pokedex, now with less data

This is sort of a combo add/remove. The concept of filling out the Pokedex is still there just as it has been since the first games, but the data is nonexistent until you acquire it - all of it.

By removing the idea of the Pokedex providing a complete entry as soon as you make a capture, it adds a series of challenges around completion and aids to the flavor of the setting being this early settlement in the world of Pokemon.

From the story perspective, you are building the first Pokedex.

It encourages you to catch multiple of the same type to catalog aspects about them, makes the grind feel like it has purpose and you're able to pick and choose which facets about research to focus on.

The completion requirements can go beyond just capture, but also include defeats, different sizes, seeing certain moves, etc.

While normally this would feel like a major grind, because of how much capture and combat has been streamlined you can knock these out a lot faster than you'd think.

### What else is gone?

Trading is no longer a requirement. Any evolution that required a trade now just uses a [Linking Cord](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Linking_Cord), or what used to be the hold item itself used during trade.

Hold items and abilities are nonexistent. This simplified a lot of planning around fights, and many Pokemon are now vulnerable in ways they hadn't been prior - like levitating no longer being an immunity to ground attacks.

Status effects, as mentioned above, are only present in fights. Sleep effects are just drowsiness, like confusion without damage & frozen has been replaced with a burn equivalent.

Breeding is not present. So, no ease of acquiring early stage Pokemon.

Gym Leader progression has been replaced with a core mission system with boss fights that leverage the action mechanics. At times it can feel repetitive, but there aren't so many that it feels cumbersome. Also, be ready to get good at dodge rolling. 

## What was the point to all of this?

To summarize the point of my ramblings, iteration doesn't always mean constantly adding to a feature set. Complex things are complex, and to be simplified must be rebuilt from the ground up. Pokemon is one such game with a plethora of deep features that could not simply be adapted to an action RPG without stripping it down to the bare bones and then building it back up again to fit its new mold.

This is one experiment I hope they decide to keep around and do a follow up on in the future.
