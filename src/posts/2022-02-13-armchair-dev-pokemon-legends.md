Legends is a master class in what happens when instead of adding more ease of use features, you remove them and make the game truly feel like survival.

Unlimited and hyper organized inventory, now limited and expansion gets exponentially expensive. When you faint as the player, you lose items from the bag. This forces you to think about what you're taking into the wild with you. Given status effects are limited to battle, this means the limited inventory space isn't as damning by not requiring you maintain constant slots for status healing items and can instead prioritize potions to fix HP.

Rather than being able to farm money from fights, it's a much bigger slog - though that gets a bit easier the more star ranks you get. Money is hard to come by early on, but you can be rewarded for captures and diversity of captures in a run.

Level scale in areas can range wildly and pose a challenge early on in the game. Alphas are a good hurdle early on as well and great add to your team. Eventually you get past those as well.

It encourages you to catch multiple of the same type to catalog aspects about them, makes the grind feel like it has purpose and you're able to pick and choose which facets about research to focus on.
